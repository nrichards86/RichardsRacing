<h4>The begininga and the Goal</h4>
<p>Richards Racing will be based out of Cincinnati, Ohio, and will start as a 1 car team. The goal will be to eventually grow to be a 4 car team in every series and be compeditive. The goal will start by having 1 car in a couple series which will be numbered the 86 car and will realistically run in the back of the pack for the first couple of years. Those first few years will be focused on finishing the race and gathering money. Some start in parks may be implimented in the Super Speedway races every now and then to save money of repairs and save some of the budget money in general. Then afer we have enough money we will start getting R&D done and then slowly expand the number of cars we operate. We wll also start as a 1 car team that runs a part time schedule at the start.</p>
